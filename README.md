**Description**:  A database of simplified bridge geometry was extracted from statewide LiDAR and DEMs for the State of Texas.  From the bridge database, it was necessary to produce interactive graphics estimating water depths for more than 19,000 bridges across Texas on an hourly basis, providing an eighteen-hour advance prediction.  These graphics are used to indicate instances when a bridge's superstructure, including beams and deck, may be at risk of flooding. <br><br>
Each cross section is cross-referenced with both the National Bridge Inventory database and the National Weather Serviceâ€™s National Water Model (NWM) stream reach. Anticipated stream flows from the National Water Model are then converted into predictions of flood depths.

  - **Technology stack**: Scripts were all developed in Python 3.8.<br><br>
  - **Status**:  Version 0.1- Preliminary release. <br><br>
  - **Related Projects**: Bridge database was created using the TX-Bridge repository.  https://github.com/andycarter-pe/tx-bridge<br>
